        A BRIEF HISTORY OF<br>THE PORSCHE 911</u></h1>

    <h3 style="font-size: medium;font-synthesis-weight:inherit;text-align: center;">It's a big year for the 911. The legendary Porsche sportscar is 60 years old in 2023.<br> Here's a handy guide to an automotive icon that continues to define pure driving enjoyment
</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">When the dust sheet was pulled back on a brand-new Porsche model at the 1963 Frankfurt International Motor Show,<br> few could have predicted the huge impact it would have on motoring in the decades to come.<br> Its name was the 901. Today it's better known as the legendary 911, its name having been changed before it went on sale.<br> Over the 60 years between 1963 and 2023, over 1.2m 911 sportscars have been made. Each one is evidence of the endless pursuit of innovation by Porsche,<br> particularly when it comes to delivering memorable drive after memorable drive for all who experience it.<br> From its early days to most recognisable models and standout moments, this is a celebration of a true automotive phenomenon.

    When was the Porsche 911 first launched?
</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Porsche 911 was first unveiled to the public on 12 September 1963 when it was launched at the Frankfurt <br>International Motor Show. Full production of the car began a year later in September 1964 at the Porsche factory in Zuffenhausen.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The second production model to be made by the company after the Porsche 356, interestingly the 911 was originally called the 901.<br> However, by the time the model went on sale it had become the 911 after a claim about naming rights from French car manufacturer, Peugeot.<br> The 911 name not only stuck but has since become synonymous with success on both road and racetrack.<br>

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: x-large;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Who designed the Porsche 911?</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">The first ever Porsche 911 was designed by F.A. Porsche  son of the founder of the company, Ferry Porsche  and his team.<br> The original 911 had an air-cooled flat-six engine instead of the four-cylinder boxer engine of the 356. It developed 130PS,<br> could accelerate from 0-100km/h in 9.1 seconds and had a top speed of 210km/h. These were hugely impressive figures for a <br>production sportscar at the time. Although there have been many versions of the 911 since then,<br> much has remained the same, like its 2 + 2 seating layout and rear engine position.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Many great Porsche designers have been involved in updating and evolving the 911 over the decades.<br> They include such legendary figures as Anatole Lapine, who designed the G series, the successor to the original 911, and <br>Harm Lagaay. This Dutchman was chief designer at Porsche from 1989 to 2004 and was the man who,<br> among many other highlights, introduced the much talked about "fried egg" headlights on the 911 (type 996).<br> And, since 2004, it's been Michael Mauer who has overseen design of the 911 in his role as Head of Style Porsche.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">These days you can choose a Porsche 911 to fit a wide range of lifestyles, like the new 911 Dakar, the first standard off-road model in the series, or the fastest production car in the current 911 line-up, the <br>911 Turbo S.Or, as Ferry Porsche once famously said, “The 911 is the only car that you can drive from an African safari to Le Mans, then to the theatre and onto the streets of New York.”

<h1 style="text-align: center;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;font-size: x-large;">How many versions of the Porsche 911 have there been?

    • 964 (1988-1994)<br>
    • 993 (1993-1998)<br>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: x-large;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;font-weight: bolder;">What's the difference between an air-cooled and water-cooled Porsche 911?
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">When it introduced the fifth generation of the 911 in 1997 – the type 996 – Porsche introduced the most radical overhaul yet of its acclaimed sportscar.<br> The biggest change that was made was a decision to stop using air-cooled engines.<br> Up until this point, the familiar sound of the air-cooled Porsche engines was one of the defining characteristics of the 911.<br> Air-cooled engines in a Porsche 911 used a combination of heat exchangers, fans and metal cooling fins to push air around the oil in the engine to cool it down and keep the engine running.<br> However, because this technology was always ‘on’, even when engines were still cold, they were rather inefficient.<br> It was a principle that led them to no longer comply with increasingly strict emissions regulations around the world.

       <h1 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;font-size: x-large;text-align: center;">At Dubai’s Solar Park, multi-billion streaming music producer and DJ<br> David Guetta stars in Speed of Light, an electrifying film about the Macan<br> Electric and Taycan sportscars
       </h1>
       <p style="text-align: center;">Speed of Light was produced by Porsche Middle East and Africa and was shot over several days – and nights – in Dubai, although<br> the preparation of a film with such an ambitious approach took several months of planning. “I think it’s possibly one of the most<br> complicated jobs any of us has ever done,” says the film’s director Kit Lynch-Robinson, of Hochkant Film.
